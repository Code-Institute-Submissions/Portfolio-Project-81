      naturopathic topics. Not on the correctness of the content of the article.<br>After authentication, the article is
      visible to everyone on the site and can only be deleted or edited by the author or an administrator. Already
      created articles
      which are edited by the author do not need to be authenticated again.<br>However, the operators of the site
      reserve the right to delete articles that no longer fit the context of the site after editing.
